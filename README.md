# Klaytn Developer Technical Challenge

This repository contains the code for my solution of the developer technical challenge for Klaytn. 

I have opted to use problem #35 and problem #47 from Project Euler. 

I have opted to use NodeJS with Mocha/Chai for testing.

## Problem 35
https://projecteuler.net/problem=35

The number, 197, is called a circular prime because all rotations of the digits: 197, 971, and 719, are themselves prime.

There are thirteen such primes below 100: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 31, 37, 71, 73, 79, and 97.

How many circular primes are there below one million?

## Problem 47
https://projecteuler.net/problem=47

The first two consecutive numbers to have two distinct prime factors are:

14 = 2 × 7
15 = 3 × 5

The first three consecutive numbers to have three distinct prime factors are:

644 = 2² × 7 × 23
645 = 3 × 5 × 43
646 = 2 × 17 × 19.

Find the first four consecutive integers to have four distinct prime factors each. What is the first of these numbers?

## Instructions
0. Fork repository
1. npm install (To install the dependencies for Mocha and Chai)
2. npm test (To run unit tests)
3. node ./app/problem35-circularPrimes.js (To run the solution for problem 35)
4. node ./app/problem47-distinctPrimesFactors.js (To run the solution for problem 47)
